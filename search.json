    "text": "Hey there,\nI am a graduate student in the MGEM (Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management) program of UBC, with a strong background in mathematics, technology, and GIS. I’ve honed skills in software development, data analysis, and machine learning through projects like AR optical recognition and predictive modeling. I also have conducted an electric vehicle regenerative braking energy project, integrating GIS and data-driven methods. Looking ahead, I aim to contribute to innovative solutions in environmental management and sustainability."

Implemented algorithms to identify ports in images of the optical cross-connection box (utilizing OpenCV for dilation, erosion, color enhancement and extraction). Generated mesh based on the identified red points. Q\nDeveloped a project aimed at identifying potential low-satisfaction users by analyzing user data. Utilized Python (sklearn) to train and compare various models. Contributed to API service development, docker image building and pushing.\nEngaged in predicting potential degradation in internet, transmission, and voice specialized lines by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques. Cleaned 5000 rows of raw data to ensure data quality and relevance. Utilized sklearn to train and compare various machine learning models, with the goal of creating accurate prediction models for detecting degradation in these specialized lines.\nCompleted the development of the API service for potential low-satisfaction users on OTN special lines, including coding, docker image packaging and pushing.\nCollaborated on the drafting of a software copyright for the AR optical cross-connection box resource calibration application system. Designed the software interface and providing instructions for interactive buttons.\n\n\n\nACTIVITIES\nElectric Vehicle Mapping Project| UBC August 2024 – Present\nConducted research on how various spatial regions, road networks, and vehicle configurations impact EV range.\nCalculated optimal routes based on EV regenerative braking\nDisplayed results on GIS maps for spatial analysis and decision support.\nImagine UBC Orientation| UBC August 2021\nOrientation Leader\nCultivated and nurtured communities of friendship and a sense of belonging for new UBC students.\nEnhanced my abilities in group and online facilitation, effective communication, community development, and team building through active involvement and leadership in this event.\nUBC Notetaker| UBC September 2023 – April 2024\nMath 360 Notetaker\nProduced high-quality notes covering course highlights and key concepts to aid students with disabilities.\nUtilized tools like Jupyter Notebook to create diverse and visually engaging notes with a combination of text, graphics, and examples to enhance learning effectiveness."

Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
