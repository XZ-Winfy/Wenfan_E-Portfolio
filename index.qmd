Hey there,

I am a graduate student in the MGEM (Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management) program of UBC, with a strong background in mathematics, technology, and GIS. Iâ€™ve honed skills in software development, data analysis, and machine learning through projects like AR optical recognition and predictive modeling. I also have conducted an electric vehicle regenerative braking energy project, integrating GIS and data-driven methods. Looking ahead, I aim to contribute to innovative solutions in environmental management and sustainability.
